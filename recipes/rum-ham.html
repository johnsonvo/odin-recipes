    <h1>Rum Ham</h1>

    <img src="../images/rum-ham.jpg" />

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (5 pound) bone-in fully-cooked ham</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can pineapple slices, undrained</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>4 fluid ounces orange-flavored rum (such as Bacardi O®), divided</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place ham into a roasting pan. Spread Dijon mustard over top and sides
        of ham in an even coat; sprinkle ham with brown sugar. Press brown sugar
        onto ham with your hands. Place pineapple slices onto ham, securing them
        to the top and sides with cloves. Place any unused pineapple slices into
        the bottom of the roasting pan and pour pineapple juice and 2 ounces
        orange-flavored rum.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until ham is heated through and brown sugar
        has begun to glaze onto the meat, about 1 hour. Remove ham from the oven
        and pour remaining 2 ounces of orange rum over the ham; carefully light
        the rum on fire with a match. The flames will help the glaze to adhere
        to the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue baking until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the
        thickest part of the ham, not touching bone, reads at least 140 degrees
        F (60 degrees C), about 1 more hour. Let ham rest for 10 minutes before
        serving. Transfer ham to a serving platter, leaving pan drippings in the
        roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth; whisk
        cornstarch into pan drippings. Place roasting pan over medium-low heat
        and whisk until pan juices thicken, about 5 minutes. Serve with ham.
      </li>
    </ol>
